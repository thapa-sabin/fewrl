# Fewrl
1. Fewrl is a URL shortener made with Flask and PostgreSQL

## Packages Required
`conda install flask psycopg2 validators` </br>
`pip install flask-sqlalchemy hashids flask-dotenv` </br>
`conda install -c conda-forge postgresql` </br>
1. I will be using conda to install packages as much as possible instead of using PIP or doing a system-wide install
